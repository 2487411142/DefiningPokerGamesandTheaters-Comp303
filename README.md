# DefiningPokerGamesandTheaters-Comp303

•	Written in Java to represent poker games and theaters to demonstrate the Design Concepts and Principles, Programming Mechanisms, Design Techniques and Patterns & Antipatterns learned in class

•	Using Concept and Principles: Encapsulation, information hiding, abstraction, immutability, ...

•	Using Java mechanisms: Assertions, Java interfaces, interface implementation, null references, optional types, nested classes, closures, unit testing frameworks, JUnit, metaprogramming, ...

•	Using design patterns: Null Object, Flyweight, Singleton, Composite, Decorator, Prototype, Command, Template Method, Observer, Visitor


This coursework demontrate what I learned in class. From a pratical point of view, the Visitor, Observer, Composite and Decorator is the most important part. I used these design 
patterns to represent a hand of cards, a theater that plays movies and different kind of movies.
